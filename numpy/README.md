* [minpy](https://github.com/dmlc/minpy)

    Minpy is a pure Numpy Interface on the top of MXNet. So it can run on GPUs. It's simple to use by swapping `import numpy as np` with `import minpy.numpy as np`

* [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd)

    Autograd allows automatic gradient computations with Numpy. However, in this repo, there will be no autograd for study purpose.
